# 🐛 Debug Delete Functionality

## Steps to Test Delete Function

1. **Open Browser Developer Tools**
   - Right-click on the page → "Inspect" 
   - Go to the "Console" tab

2. **Try Deleting a Dustbin**
   - Click the red trash icon (🗑️) next to any dustbin
   - Watch the console for messages

3. **Expected Console Messages**
   ```
   Delete button clicked for: [Dustbin Name] ID: [ID]
   Attempting to delete dustbin from Firebase...
   ✅ Dustbin deleted successfully from Firebase
   ```

4. **If You See Permission Errors**
   - Go to Firebase Console → Firestore Database → Rules
   - Replace with this rule:
   ```javascript
   rules_version = '2';
   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       match /{document=**} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   - Click "Publish"

5. **Common Issues & Solutions**
   - **No console messages**: Button click not registering - refresh page
   - **Permission denied**: Update Firebase security rules
   - **Network error**: Check internet connection
   - **Auth error**: Make sure you're logged in

## Test Results
After clicking delete, you should see:
- Confirmation dialog asking "Are you sure..."
- Console logs showing the delete process
- Success alert if deletion works
- Error alert with specific message if it fails
